# Rules
# 1. You can change the variables names and numbers, such as
# def run(a, b, c, d):
#   return int(a) + int(b) + int(c) + int(d)
# 2. You should assume the variables are always strings,
# and thus you can always cast the variables to the desired format, for example
# define run(height, length):
#   return float(height) * float(length)
def run(a, b):
    return int(a) + int(b)
